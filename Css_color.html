		<h1>Fishing</h1>
		 <p>Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught 
			in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, 
			angling and trapping.</p>
	
		<p> The term fishing may be applied to catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs, 
			cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching
		    farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales, where the term whaling is 
		    more appropriate.</p>
		
		<p> Fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the 
			Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago.[3] Isotopic analysis of the skeletal 
			remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year old modern human from eastern Asia, has 
			shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.[4][5] Archaeology features such 
			as shell middens,[6] discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods 
			were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this 
			period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, 
			constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent 
			settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at 
			Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source 
			of food. </p>

				<li><h3>Techniques</h3>Fishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing,
				 netting, angling and trapping. Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers
				  use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational 
				  fishers fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit.
				  </li>
				<li><h3>Tackle</h3> Fishing tackle is a general term that refers to the equipment
				 used by fishermen when fishing.
                 Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle.
                 Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, 
                 spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes.
				 Tackle that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal 
				 tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings 
				 and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner 
				 blades to fishing lures.<li>
				 <li><h3>Fishing vessels</h3>A fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch
				  fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels 
				  are used in commercial, artisanal and recreational fishing.</li>
