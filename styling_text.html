		<h1>Fishing</h1>
		 <p>Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught 
			in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, 
			angling and trapping.</p>

		<p> 	The term fishing may be applied to catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs, 
			cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching
		    farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales, where the term whaling is 
		    more appropriate.</p>
		
		<p> 	Fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the 
			Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago.[3] Isotopic analysis of the skeletal 
			remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year old modern human from eastern Asia, has 
			shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.[4][5] Archaeology features such 
			as shell middens,[6] discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods 
			were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this 
			period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, 
			constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent 
			settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at 
			Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source 
			of food. </p>
		<p>The ancient river Nile was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food
		 for much of the population.[7] The Egyptians had implements and methods for fishing
		  and these are illustrated in tomb scenes, drawings, and papyrus documents. Some 
		  representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime. In India, the 
		  Pandyas, a classical Dravidian Tamil kingdom, were known for the pearl fishery 
		  as early as the 1st century BC. Their seaport Tuticorin was known for deep sea 
		  pearl fishing. The Paravas, a Tamil caste centred in Tuticorin, developed a rich
		   community because of their pearl trade, navigation knowledge and fisheries. 
		   Seafood played a central role in the food culture of ancient Greeks,though 
		   fishing scenes are rarely represented in their art, a reflection of the low 
		   social status of fishing. Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major 
		   treatise on sea fishing; the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and
		   180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. 
		    Pictorial evidence of Roman fishing comes from mosaics. The Roman god of the
		    sea Neptune is depicted as wielding a fishing trident. The Moche people of 
		    ancient Peru depicted fishermen in their ceramics.One of the worldâ€™s longest 
		    trading histories is the trade of dry cod from the Lofoten area of Norway to 
		    the southern parts of Europe, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The trade in cod 
		    started during the Viking period or before, has been going on for more than 
		    1,000 years and is still important.</p>

				<li><h3><a id="Techniques">Techniques</a></h3>
				 Fishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing,
				 netting, angling and trapping. Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers
				  use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational 
				  fishers fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit.
				  </li>
				<li><h3><a id="Tackle">Tackle</a></h3> Fishing tackle is a general term that refers to the equipment
				 used by fishermen when fishing.
                 Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle.
                 Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, 
                 spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes.
				 Tackle that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal 
				 tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings 
				 and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner 
				 blades to fishing lures.</li>
				 <li><h3><a id="Fishing Vessels">Fishing Vessels</a></h3>A fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch
				  fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels 
				  are used in commercial, artisanal and recreational fishing.</li>
